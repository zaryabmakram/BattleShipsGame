BattleShipsGame
Microsoft: DEV277x - Object Oriented Programming in Java - Module 1 Project 
This is a recreation of the game of battleships.
 In this game, a player will place 5 of their ships on a 10 by 10 grid map. 
The computer player will deploy five ships on the same grid. 
Once the game starts the player and computer take turns, trying to sink each other's ships by guessing the coordinates. 
The game ends when either the player or computer has no ships left.
